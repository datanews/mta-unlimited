# MTA Unlimited Metrocard Usage

This CSV includes data supplied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on the use of 7-day and 30-day unlimited Metrocards in the New York subway.  Data covers swipes in May 2014 between 6am and 10am (morning commuters), and excludes 15 hub stations (e.g. 34th St-Penn Station).  It merges this data with census tract-level information on median income and poverty for each station.  Stations on the border of Central Park and another census tract are treated as lying in the more populous tract.
